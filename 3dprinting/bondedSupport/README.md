This is a bonded support to avoid the drilling onto the steering column. The support can be bonded with double sided tape. 
This has been tested with thick double sided tape, hard acceleration and driving, and high cabin temperatures.

Material tested on the pictures is Nylon PA12. I recommend using a good quality / gel type double sided tape if you use PA materials (at least 1.5 mm thick).
You will also need some bonding agent to assemble the two pieces together. 

Mounting instructions : 

1. Bond the phone holder and the bonded support together. Use a strong gel type blue (example : Pattex Repair extreme).

2. Pass the USB C cable through the hole and the tunnel.
3. Using a post-it, mark around 3,8 cm or 1,5 inches from the edge of the steering column.

4. Apply some double sided tape in the squares underneath. Use some THICK gel type double sided tape, or it will not bond properly.

5. Check the positionning with the post-it. 
6. If everything is positionning proprerly, remove the top layer of the double sided tape and bond the whole thing.
7. Connect your Pixel 2 XL and insert it.
8. Enjoy.
